#### ***What information do I need to use the mortgage calculator?***

To use a mortgage calculator effectively, you need to input several pieces of information:
  - Desired Monthly Payment: The amount you are willing to pay monthly.
  - Down Payment: The initial up-front payment.
  - Interest rate: The rate at which interest will accrue on your loan.
  - Loan term: The length of time over which you will repay the loan, typically 15 or 30 years.
  - Property Tax Rate: The tax on a property.
  
  ***Optional inputs might include:***
  - Expected HOA Fee: Homeowners association fee to maintain all properties, shared amenities, and common areas within the association.
  - Private Mortgage Insurance: A type of insurance for certain mortgages with high loan-to-value ratios that protects the lender.


#### ***How accurate are mortgage calculators?***

While mortgage calculators can provide valuable insights into monthly or total payments, it's essential to recognize that they offer estimates rather than exact figures. These calculations often overlook crucial factors such as fluctuations in property taxes, insurance premiums, and changes in interest rates for adjustable-rate mortgages. Furthermore, maintenance costs and utilities are typically not included, which is vital information when considering the full scope of housing expenses.

As a result, mortgage calculators should be viewed as excellent starting points for initial planning and comparisons, but actual mortgage payments may vary slightly due to these variables and lender-specific requirements. To gain a more accurate understanding of your financial commitment, it's essential to consider all these factors and consult with a qualified professional before making a decision.


#### ***What is Private Mortgage Insurance?***

When a homebuyer takes out a home loan or refinances their mortgage, their lender may require to pay PMI. The national average ranges from 0.19% to 2.25%. The amount a homebuyer will pay is based on two factors: 
- the total loan amount: PMI costs are usually higher for larger mortgages
- the homebuyers credit score: Lenders usually charge those with higher credit scores lower PMI percentages
Lenders may require it depending on the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. If the homebuyer needs PMI, the lender will choose the provider of their choice. Typically, lenders will require homeowners to pay PMI while their LTV is above 80%. Once their LTV is below 80%, the homebuyer can request to stop paying PMI.


#### ***What is HOA?***

HOAs (Homeowners Associations) are communities that create rules for properties and residents. If you buy a home within an HOA's jurisdiction, you'll need to pay their fees - it's not optional.

Before buying, understand the HOA's rules, as they can be strict about things like property changes or decorations. The HOA is made up of community residents, and fees depend on factors like location, number of properties, amenities, and type of property.

On average, HOA fees cost between $100 to $1,000 per year. Fees are used for common area maintenance, renovation projects, and emergencies.


#### ***What are property taxes?***

As an owner of real estate within a government jurisdiction, you're required to pay property taxes annually or semi-annually. These taxes are used to fund essential services that benefit your community, including:

* Schools
* Police departments
* Fire departments
* Libraries
* Local infrastructure and development projects

The amount of property tax varies depending on the location, with rates ranging from 0.31% to 1.64%. For example, if you own a $200,000 home in an area with a 0.5% property tax rate, your annual taxes would be $1,000.
