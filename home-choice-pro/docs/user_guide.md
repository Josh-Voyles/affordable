### FAQ
***What is **Home Choice Pro**?***
**Home Choice Pro** is a tool that helps potential homebuyers estimate not just their total cost, but other factors that will better prepare them. It takes into account various factors such as their desired monthly payment, down payment, interest rate, loan term, and HOA. By providing these details, users can get a better idea of what they might expect to pay all around. Unlike other mortgage calculators, **Home Choice Pro** starts with the user's desired monthly payment first. It takes that number and the other provided input, and provides the homebuyer with their personalized home affordability. They are also provided with loan total cost, principal, and interest.
***What information do I need to use the mortgage calculator?***
To use a mortgage calculator effectively, you need to input several pieces of information:
  - Desired Monthly Payment: The amount you are willing to pay monthly.
  - Down Payment: The initial up-front payment.
  - Interest rate: The rate at which interest will accrue on your loan.
  - Loan term: The length of time over which you will repay the loan, typically 15 or 30 years.
  - Property Tax Rate: The tax on a property.
  ***Optional inputs might include:***
  - Expected HOA Fee: Homeowners association fee to maintain all properties, shared amenities, and common areas within the association.
  - Private Mortgage Insurance: A type of insurance for certain mortgages with high LTV ratios that protects the lender.
***How accurate are mortgage calculators?***
Mortgage calculators provide a good estimate of monthly or total payment(s) but should be considered approximations. They often don't account for fluctuations in property taxes, insurance premiums, or changes in interest rates for adjustable-rate mortgages. Additionally, they don't include maintenance costs or utilities, which need to be considered for a complete understanding of housing expenses. Therefore, while mortgage calculators are excellent for initial planning and comparisons, the actual mortgage payment may vary slightly due to these variables and lender-specific requirements.
***What is Private Mortgage Insurance?***
When a homebuyer takes out a home loan or refinances their mortgage, their lender may require to pay PMI. The national average ranges from 0.19% to 2.25%. The amount a homebuyer will pay is based on two factors: 
- the total loan amount: PMI costs are usually higher for larger mortgages
- the homebuyers credit score: Lenders usually charge those with higher credit scores lower PMI percentages
Lenders may require it depending on the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. If the homebuyer needs PMI, the lender will choose the provider of their choice. Typically, lenders will require homeowners to pay PMI while their LTV is above 80%. Once their LTV is below 80%, the homebuyer can request to stop paying PMI.
