### FAQ
***What is a mortgage calculator?***
A mortgage calculator is an online tool that helps potential homebuyers estimate their monthly or total mortgage payment(s). It takes into account various factors such as the loan amount, interest rate, loan term, and sometimes additional costs like property taxes, homeowners insurance, and private mortgage insurance (PMI). By providing these details, users can get a rough idea of what they might expect to pay each month for their mortgage.
***What information do I need to use the mortgage calculator?***
To use a mortgage calculator effectively, you need to input several pieces of information:
  - Loan amount: The total amount of money you are borrowing to buy your home.
  - Interest rate: The rate at which interest will accrue on your loan.
  - Loan term: The length of time over which you will repay the loan, typically 15, 20, or 30 years.
  ***Optional inputs might include:***
  - Down payment: The amount of money you pay upfront toward the purchase price of the home.
  - Property taxes: Annual taxes assessed by a government authority on your property, which are often estimated as a percentage of the property value.
  - Homeowners insurance: An estimate of the insurance cost to cover potential damages to your home.
  - PMI: Private mortgage insurance, which might be required if your down payment is less than 20% of the home's purchase price.
***How accurate are mortgage calculators?***
Mortgage calculators provide a good estimate of monthly or total payment(s) but should be considered approximations. They often don't account for fluctuations in property taxes, insurance premiums, or changes in interest rates for adjustable-rate mortgages. Additionally, they don't include maintenance costs or utilities, which need to be considered for a complete understanding of housing expenses. Therefore, while mortgage calculators are excellent for initial planning and comparisons, the actual mortgage payment may vary slightly due to these variables and lender-specific requirements.
